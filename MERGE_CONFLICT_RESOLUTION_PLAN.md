# Navigate to your worktree
cd /home/codingbutter/GitHub/raffle-worktrees/stripe-subscription-expert

# Fetch latest changes
git fetch origin

# Pull latest development branch
git pull origin development

# Resolve conflicts
# Focus on:
# - apps/website/app/dashboard/* (analytics components)

# Fetch latest changes

```

## Technical Considerations

### Common Conflict Areas

1. **Package dependencies** - Ensure package.json conflicts are resolved correctly
2. **Import statements** - Watch for duplicate or conflicting imports
3. **Type definitions** - Ensure TypeScript types remain consistent
4. **Component structure** - Maintain separation of concerns during resolution

### Quality Gates to Verify

- [ ] All files remain under 200 lines
- [ ] No duplicate code introduced
- [ ] TypeScript compilation passes
- [ ] ESLint checks pass
- [ ] Build succeeds for affected packages

## Timeline

- **Target Resolution**: Within 2 hours
- **Validation**: 30 minutes after resolution
- **Merge to development**: Immediately after validation

## Coordination Protocol

1. Each specialist resolves their conflicts independently
2. Report completion status to lead-developer-architect
3. Lead-developer-architect validates resolutions
4. PRs merged in order: PR #34 first (refactoring), then PR #35 (new feature)

## Success Criteria

- Both PRs show "Ready to merge" status
- No build failures in CI/CD
- All quality checks pass
- Sprint progress unblocked
