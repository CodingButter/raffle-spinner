# Architecture Issues Created - 2025-08-18

## Overview
David Miller (Lead Developer Architect) has identified and documented critical architectural issues in the DrawDay monorepo. These issues require immediate attention to maintain code quality, performance, and security standards.

## Issues Created

### 1. 🔴 CRITICAL: Multiple 500+ Line Files Violating 200-Line Limit
- **Issue**: [#43](https://github.com/CodingButter/raffle-spinner/issues/43)
- **Severity**: CRITICAL
- **Impact**: Blocks code quality standards, increases complexity
- **Key Files**: SlotMachineWheel.tsx (579 lines), SlotMachineWheelFixed.tsx (566 lines)
- **Action Required**: Immediate refactoring sprint

### 2. ⚠️ Monorepo Package Naming Inconsistency
- **Issue**: [#45](https://github.com/CodingButter/raffle-spinner/issues/45)
- **Severity**: MEDIUM
- **Impact**: Developer confusion, unclear boundaries
- **Problem**: Mixed naming conventions (@drawday/*, @raffle-spinner/*, no namespace)
- **Action Required**: Migration to consistent namespace strategy

### 3. ⚠️ Missing Dependency Injection Pattern
- **Issue**: [#47](https://github.com/CodingButter/raffle-spinner/issues/47)
- **Severity**: MEDIUM
- **Impact**: Poor testability, platform lock-in
- **Problem**: Direct imports create tight coupling
- **Action Required**: Implement DI pattern for services

### 4. 🟡 Performance Budget Not Enforced in CI/CD
- **Issue**: [#49](https://github.com/CodingButter/raffle-spinner/issues/49)
- **Severity**: HIGH
- **Impact**: Risk of performance regression
- **Problem**: No automated bundle size or performance checks
- **Action Required**: Enforce size-limit and performance tests in CI

### 5. 🟡 Circular Dependency Risk Between Packages
- **Issue**: [#51](https://github.com/CodingButter/raffle-spinner/issues/51)
- **Severity**: HIGH
- **Impact**: Potential build failures, unclear architecture
- **Problem**: No import restrictions or layering enforcement
- **Action Required**: Implement strict package layering

### 6. ⚠️ Missing Error Boundary Strategy
- **Issue**: [#53](https://github.com/CodingButter/raffle-spinner/issues/53)
- **Severity**: MEDIUM
- **Impact**: Poor error handling, white screen of death
- **Problem**: No consistent error boundaries across apps
- **Action Required**: Implement global and component error boundaries

### 7. ⚠️ Build System Optimization Needed
- **Issue**: [#56](https://github.com/CodingButter/raffle-spinner/issues/56)
- **Severity**: MEDIUM
- **Impact**: Slow builds affect productivity
- **Problem**: Sequential builds, no caching
- **Action Required**: Implement Turborepo for parallel builds

### 8. 🟡 Missing Integration Testing Strategy
- **Issue**: [#61](https://github.com/CodingButter/raffle-spinner/issues/61)
- **Severity**: HIGH
- **Impact**: Low release confidence
- **Problem**: No cross-package or E2E testing
- **Action Required**: Implement Playwright and integration tests

### 9. 🔴 Security Headers and CSP Not Configured
- **Issue**: [#64](https://github.com/CodingButter/raffle-spinner/issues/64)
- **Severity**: CRITICAL
- **Impact**: Security vulnerabilities, compliance issues
- **Problem**: Missing CSP and security headers
- **Action Required**: Immediate security configuration

### 10. ⚠️ State Management Architecture Needs Standardization
- **Issue**: [#68](https://github.com/CodingButter/raffle-spinner/issues/68)
- **Severity**: MEDIUM
- **Impact**: State inconsistency, debugging difficulties
- **Problem**: Mixed state management patterns
- **Action Required**: Standardize on Zustand with persistence

## Priority Matrix

### Immediate Action (P0 - Critical)
1. File size violations (#43) - Blocking quality gates
2. Security headers (#64) - Security vulnerability

### High Priority (P1 - This Sprint)
1. Performance budget enforcement (#49)
2. Circular dependency prevention (#51)
3. Integration testing (#61)

### Medium Priority (P2 - Next Sprint)
1. Package naming (#45)
2. Dependency injection (#47)
3. Error boundaries (#53)
4. Build optimization (#56)
5. State management (#68)

## Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) Needed

1. **ADR-001**: Large File Refactoring Strategy
2. **ADR-002**: Monorepo Package Namespace Strategy
3. **ADR-003**: Dependency Injection Strategy
4. **ADR-004**: Performance Budget Enforcement
5. **ADR-005**: Package Layering and Dependencies
6. **ADR-006**: Error Boundary and Recovery
7. **ADR-007**: Build System Optimization
8. **ADR-008**: Integration Testing Strategy
9. **ADR-009**: Security Headers and CSP
10. **ADR-010**: State Management Architecture

## Metrics to Track

### Code Quality
- Files over 200 lines: Currently 30+ files
- Target: 0 files over 200 lines

### Performance
- Build time: Currently >30 seconds
- Target: <30 seconds full build, <5 seconds incremental

### Testing
- Integration test coverage: Currently 0%
- Target: >80% critical paths covered

### Security
- Security headers implemented: 0/10
- Target: Full OWASP compliance

## Next Steps

1. **Immediate**: Address critical security and file size issues
2. **This Week**: Set up performance monitoring and CI gates
3. **This Sprint**: Implement integration testing framework
4. **Next Sprint**: Refactor state management and optimize builds
