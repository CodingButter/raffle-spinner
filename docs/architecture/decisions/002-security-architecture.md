# ADR-002: Security Architecture Improvements

## Status
Accepted

## Context
Our security audit revealed critical vulnerabilities that could compromise user data and system integrity:

1. **Wide-open CORS policy** allowing any domain to access authentication endpoints
2. **No rate limiting** on API endpoints, making the system vulnerable to brute force attacks
3. **Missing CSP headers** exposing the application to XSS attacks
4. **Token storage in localStorage** vulnerable to XSS token theft
5. **No input validation** on API endpoints
6. **Direct error message exposure** leaking internal system details

These vulnerabilities represent significant risks:
- User accounts could be compromised through brute force
- Authentication tokens could be stolen via XSS
- Internal system architecture exposed through error messages
- Cross-origin attacks possible due to permissive CORS

## Decision
We have implemented a comprehensive security architecture with multiple layers of defense:

### 1. Content Security Policy (CSP)
- Strict CSP headers preventing inline scripts and restricting resource loading
- Frame ancestors set to 'none' preventing clickjacking
- Upgrade insecure requests enforced

### 2. Rate Limiting
- Endpoint-specific rate limits:
  - Login: 5 attempts per 15 minutes
  - Registration: 3 attempts per hour
  - API: 60 requests per minute
  - Stripe webhooks: 100 requests per minute
- In-memory store for development, Redis recommended for production

### 3. CORS Configuration
- Restricted to known origins only:
  - Production domains: drawday.app, www.drawday.app
  - Chrome extensions via pattern matching
  - Localhost only in development
- Credentials included for authenticated requests

### 4. Secure Token Management
- JWT tokens with proper signing and verification
- HttpOnly cookies for token storage (implementation pending)
- 15-minute access token expiry
- 7-day refresh token expiry

### 5. Input Validation
- Zod schemas for all API endpoints
- Email format validation
- Password complexity requirements
- UUID format validation for IDs
- Stripe ID format validation

### 6. Error Sanitization
- Generic error messages for production
- Sensitive pattern detection and removal
- No internal paths or database details exposed

## Consequences

### Positive
- **Eliminated XSS vulnerability** through CSP and secure token storage
- **Prevented brute force attacks** via rate limiting
- **Blocked cross-origin attacks** with proper CORS configuration
- **Protected against injection** through input validation
- **Reduced information leakage** via error sanitization
- **Improved overall security posture** significantly

### Negative
- **Slightly increased complexity** in API route implementation
- **Additional dependencies** (jose for JWT, zod for validation)
- **Performance overhead** from validation and rate limiting (minimal)
- **Breaking change** for Chrome extension CORS handling

## Alternatives Considered

1. **OAuth2/OIDC Provider**: Considered using Auth0 or Clerk
   - Rejected: Additional cost and vendor lock-in
   
2. **Session-based Auth**: Traditional server-side sessions
   - Rejected: Doesn't work well with Chrome extensions
   
3. **API Gateway**: Kong or AWS API Gateway for rate limiting
   - Rejected: Over-engineering for current scale

## Rollback Plan

1. Remove middleware.ts to disable CSP and rate limiting
2. Revert API route changes to restore old CORS headers
3. Remove @drawday/security package dependency
4. Restore original auth service implementation

## Success Metrics

- **Zero security incidents** in first 30 days
- **<0.1% false positive rate** on rate limiting
- **No legitimate user complaints** about access issues
- **Pass OWASP Top 10** security audit
- **100% of API endpoints** with input validation

## Implementation Checklist

- [x] Architecture tests added
- [ ] HttpOnly cookie implementation (next phase)
- [ ] Redis rate limiting for production
- [ ] Security monitoring dashboard

## Migration Guide

### For Frontend Developers
```typescript
// Old: Wide-open CORS
fetch('https://api.drawday.app/auth/login')

// New: Origin must be whitelisted
fetch('https://api.drawday.app/auth/login', {
  credentials: 'include', // Required for cookies
})
```

### For API Developers
```typescript
// Old: No validation
export async function POST(request: NextRequest) {
  const body = await request.json();
  // Use body directly
}

// New: With validation
import { loginSchema } from '@drawday/security';

export async function POST(request: NextRequest) {
  const body = await request.json();
  const result = loginSchema.safeParse(body);
  if (!result.success) {
    return NextResponse.json({ error: 'Invalid input' }, { status: 400 });
  }
  // Use result.data
}
```
